# Presentation of the Working Group Results on Film Restoration Documentation Part II

After three years of collective effort, we are pleased to present the results of our work. This initiative was driven by a collaborative approach, bringing together experts from various institutions within the FIAF community to establish a consensus on the essential data worth preserving after a restoration project is completed. We deeply appreciate the dedication and contributions of all specialists involved in this endeavor.

The current phase of the Task Force is based on the assumption that all this information should be or could be collected and presented in your cataloging and collection management system, in compliance with the FIAF Cataloguing Manual and CEN 15907.

**TODO, ADD LINK BELOW.**

Here, you can find the table.

The table is intended to serve as an inspiration for integrating this information into your cataloging and collection management systems. As part of this initiative, the scope and function of Preservation Events entities in the cataloguing and documenting process have been expanded.

The values of controlled vocabularies, as well as the sample data contained in the table, serve as illustrative examples and may not cover all possible data points. Their purpose is to provide an overview of the function of each section, in the perspective of a future adoption, each institution will be able to establish its own controlled vocabularies. However, if you notice any errors or have suggestions, please inform us. 

The outcomes of the working group's discussions will also be reflected in the upcoming revision of the FIAF Cataloguing Manual.

We invite you to review the results reached by our working group. Your feedback is highly valued—please send your comments to elzbieta.wysocka@fina.gov.pl / cdc@fiaf.org. If you wish to join the working group, do not hesitate to reach out.

**Background of the Project**

**Part I** of the project was initiated in 2018 by TC as Documentation of the Preservation/Restoration Task Force. It comprises the results of work carried out by Laurent Bismuth (CNC), the previous rapporteur of this Task Force, who managed it in collaboration with colleagues from the FIAF Technical Commission, particularly Céline Ruivo and Caroline Fournier. 
Following the initial drafting of Part I, the Task Force experienced a temporary pause due to the unavailability of Laurent Bismuth, who left the commission for health reasons and, sadly, passed away in December 2021. The project resumed under the leadership of Maria Assunta Pimpinelli and myself in October 2021.
Part I, which is now considered complete and internally consistent, serves as a textual report independent of cataloging or collection management systems. It includes essential details such as the identification of the film, classification, objectives, restoration rationale, and an in-depth analysis of selected film elements. It also documents the genealogy of film materials, comparative assessments of sources, and the condition of elements used in the restoration process.

**Transition to Part II – Workflow and Data Documentation**

After the completion of Part I, we recognized the necessity of a second phase focusing on workflows. While Part I provided a structured narrative, Part II takes a data-driven approach by systematically documenting restoration processes. This phase is based on insights gathered from a structured selective survey Preservation/Restoration Events and Documentation of workflow consisting of seven sheets. It captures what archives actually document, as well as suggestions what they should keep by expert knowledge from archivists and restoration specialists worldwide.

One of our primary objectives is to align the documentation of restoration events with the CEN 15907 standard and the FIAF Cataloguing Manual, which is currently undergoing revision. We identified that much of the data from Part I might already exist in archival databases under Manifestation and Item entities. However, what is often missing is detailed documentation of the restoration process itself—the rationale behind each step and the decision-making involved as well as the technical data of the process, which is not preserved in the metadata of the generated file. 

This information can be collected in standalone text reports attached to the final restoration products as pdf. However, another option - in many ways a very effective approach is to structure it as **Preservation Events**, which is here proposed for further development.

Thanks to this, we achieve a permanently integrated, open, hypertextual, and multidimensional representation of the individual history and workflow behind the restoration project in the collection management system.

Preservation Events enable the documentation of the interconnections between source materials, intermediate products, and final restored versions. They capture crucial details such as time taken, methodologies applied, and people involved. Through this, we aim to define a standardized set of fields, data formats, controlled vocabularies, and relational structures.

**Alternative Approaches to Film Restoration Documentation**

The working group members presented other internally functioning documentation methods that are in excellent use within their institutions and work effectively without being linked to collection management systems (CMS). We hope there will be an opportunity to showcase them, as they may serve as a valuable source of inspiration for organizations where such a cataloging software extension is either impossible or undesirable.

**How to Use the Table**

The table can be used as a foundation to define new fields and methods for acquiring information, as well as linking it to existing entities in your CMS, such as Agents, Manifestations, Items, Events, and objects from non-film collections that were crucial to the restoration process. It is meant to inspire further work and customisation on controlled vocabularies and the automation of information-gathering processes.

How to interpret the information provided:

- Each "Event" tab represents a sequential step in the preservation/restoration process and is highlighted in a different color.
- Non-editable sections are divided by dark gray rows.
- Information relevant to Collection Management Systems administrators is highlighted in green.
- At the end, there is a column with example entries—we encourage you to contribute;.
- The relevance of information according to the Working Group is marked in red.
- We plan to add tabs for sound restoration and printing / recording. 

This table is not intended to be filled out in its current form. Instead, it should be integrated into the software of your collection management system (CMS) used by your institution. The goal is for it to serve as a part of your digital infrastructure, enhancing the way data is captured and structured within your system.

It may also assist you in selecting the information that should be requested from the studio to which you outsource the film restoration services. The structure and fields outlined in the table will guide you in specifying the necessary data from the service provider, ensuring you gather all the critical details relevant to the restoration project.
